The Network Security Monitor is an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) designed to detect and prevent network-based attacks. It monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic for suspicious activities, including port scans, SYN flood attacks, ARP spoofing, and DNS poisoning.

Using Nmap, the tool actively scans the network for open ports and services, checking them against known vulnerabilities. It applies custom security rules to detect malicious behaviour and blocks potentially harmful IPs or MAC addresses.

The system also generates detailed security reports, tracking all detected threats and blocked sources. These reports provide valuable insights into attack patterns, helping administrators take proactive measures to secure their network.

With real-time monitoring and automatic attack prevention, this tool significantly improves network security, reducing the risk of cyber threats and unauthorised access.
